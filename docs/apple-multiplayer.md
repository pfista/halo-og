# Apple multiplayer and Mac invite links

Build both devices from the same revision with the same map set. Native builds
use protocol version 11 and changed player capacities, so original Xbox games
and older native builds cannot join. See the [shared System Link notes](../port/linux/README.md#system-link)
for protocol details and limits.

Upstream v11 interoperability covers original-rule sessions with the same maps.
This build refuses unsupported PC gametype options before loading; use the
original options, and leave Infinite Grenades off in mixed-build games with five
or more players. PB Options require compatible fork builds when enabled. See the
[v11 review and exact compatibility boundary](xbox-fidelity.md#protocol-compatibility).

## Play on Mac using an invite

Open `build/macos/Halo OG.app`. Allow local network access if macOS
asks. Internet play and clipboard invites are enabled in the default settings.

1. On the host, choose **Multiplayer → System Link**, select a player profile,
   then create a game with **Y / Tab**. Pick a map and mode.
2. Hosting copies a `halo://join/` link to the clipboard. Paste it into a message
   for the other players. The link is also in `halo.log` in the save directory.
3. On a joining Mac, open the link. Alternatively, copy the link and bring Halo
   to the front. Go to **Multiplayer → System Link**, select a profile, and join
   the advertised game.
4. Once everyone appears in the lobby, start the match on the host.

The app registers the `halo://` scheme. macOS delivers an opened link to the
running app; the host queues it in that instance's save directory. A development
launch can also take the link as an argument:

```sh
"build/macos/Halo OG.app/Contents/MacOS/halo" 'halo://join/YOUR_64_HEX_DIGITS'
```

Invites last for the hosting game process. Treat the link as access to the room.
Keep the host running and send a new invite after restarting it.

Gameplay travels directly between players. Public MQTT brokers provide
signaling and public STUN services help discover network addresses; UPnP can
ask a compatible router to forward a port. There is no game server or relay
to pay for. These public services and some NAT/firewall combinations can still
prevent a connection. This build does not provide guaranteed connectivity,
host migration, or a browser client. See the
[upstream connection notes](../port/linux/README.md#connection).

The original scoreboard remains; received ping telemetry does not add a new
column. The shared [netcode reference](../port/linux/NETCODE.md) describes host
rules. Set `game.console_log` in `config.toml` to `"all"`, `"important"` or
`"none"`; command responses and stopping asserts remain visible.

## Connect the devices

Put the Mac and iPhone on the same LAN. Find the Mac's Wi-Fi IPv4 address in
System Settings → Wi-Fi → Details → TCP/IP, and the phone's in Settings → Wi-Fi
→ the information button beside the connected network. Allow Halo's local
network access when prompted. Guest networks with client isolation prevent
devices from reaching each other.

The current iPhone build uses explicit peer addresses for discovery. It does
not request Apple's multicast entitlement, which iOS requires for UDP
broadcast/multicast; ordinary unicast to the other device avoids that requirement.
See Apple's [multicast entitlement documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.networking.multicast).

Quit existing copies of Halo. From the repository root, replace the placeholder
values below with your devices' current addresses:

```sh
MAC_IP=YOUR_MAC_WIFI_IP
PHONE_IP=YOUR_IPHONE_WIFI_IP

open -n \
  --env "HALO_NET_ADDRESS=$MAC_IP" \
  --env "HALO_NET_BROADCAST=$PHONE_IP" \
  "build/macos/Halo OG.app"
```

For the iPhone, set these environment variables in Xcode → Product → Scheme →
Edit Scheme → Run → Arguments, then run the app:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `HALO_NET_ADDRESS` | The iPhone's Wi-Fi IPv4 address |
| `HALO_NET_BROADCAST` | The Mac's Wi-Fi IPv4 address |

Alternatively, install using the [iPhone instructions](../port/ios/README.md#install-on-a-phone)
and launch from the same shell as the Mac command. Replace the device and bundle
identifiers with your own:

```sh
xcrun devicectl device process launch --terminate-existing \
  --device YOUR_DEVICE_ID \
  --environment-variables "{\"HALO_NET_ADDRESS\":\"$PHONE_IP\",\"HALO_NET_BROADCAST\":\"$MAC_IP\"}" \
  com.yourname.halo
```

These environment settings apply only to that launch. To retain them for normal
launches, edit the existing `[network]` section of each device's `config.toml`:
set `address` to that device's IP and `broadcast` to the other device's IP. The
[Mac guide](../port/macos/README.md#launch) and [iPhone guide](../port/ios/README.md#install-on-a-phone)
give the save locations. Update these values if Wi-Fi or DHCP changes the
addresses. Keep personal addresses and generated Xcode schemes out of commits.

## Start a match

1. On the Mac, choose **Multiplayer → System Link**, select a player profile,
   and create a game (Y / Tab). Choose a map and a mode such as Blood Gulch / Slayer.
2. On the iPhone, choose **Multiplayer → System Link**, select a profile and
   join the Mac's advertised game.
3. Wait until both players appear in the lobby, then start the match on the host.

The session should keep running after both maps load, and movement, shots and
damage should agree on both devices. This setup covers LAN multiplayer; it does
not establish campaign co-op, internet matchmaking or compatibility with every
other native platform.

## Diagnosing a disconnect

The Darwin adapter handles Halo's connected UDP sockets specially: Halo still
passes the server address to `sendto()` after connecting, which Apple rejects
with `EISCONN`. The adapter retries with `send()` only if the destination matches
the connected datagram peer. Without this fix, discovery and joining work, but
gameplay packets fail and the match closes shortly after loading. Rebuild both
apps if either predates the fix.

The socket regression probe uses loopback and needs no game data or SDK:

```sh
mkdir -p build/macos/tests
clang -arch arm64 -O2 -Wall -I. -Iport/linux/src \
  port/macos/tests/host_network.c port/macos/host/posix_net.c \
  -o build/macos/tests/host_network
build/macos/tests/host_network
```

It checks discovery sends, connected gameplay sends with explicit and omitted
destinations, empty datagrams, truncated datagrams, received
addresses and refusal to redirect a mismatched destination to the connected peer.
It also runs as part of `python3 tools/test_macos_runtime.py`.

The real-game smoke test uses separate saves and settings for two copies on one
Mac. It exercises either LAN discovery or an encrypted invite and records
movement and network updates. It requires game maps and a configured LAN IPv4
address, while keeping personal saves, clipboard and Discord activity untouched:

```sh
python3 tools/macos_multiplayer_smoke.py --mode invite --seconds 65 \
  --output build/macos/multiplayer/invite-test
python3 tools/macos_multiplayer_smoke.py --mode lan --seconds 65 \
  --output build/macos/multiplayer/lan-test
python3 tools/macos_multiplayer_smoke.py --mode invite --seconds 95 \
  --variants slayer,slayer --score 1 \
  --output build/macos/multiplayer/consecutive-test
```

Use a fresh output directory for each run. Two physical Macs on different
networks and 128-player capacity still need separate testing.
LAN mode also needs a second configured non-loopback IPv4 address on the Mac
(for example an existing VPN interface); it discovers that address automatically
or accepts `--client-address`. Invite mode works with LAN plus loopback.
Same-machine tests do not establish discovery across physical devices,
Internet/NAT connectivity, maximum player counts or campaign co-op.
For a private Discord RPC smoke check without changing Discord activity:

```sh
python3 tools/macos_discord_smoke.py
python3 tools/macos_discord_smoke.py --offline
```

These verify Playing presence in the real game with internet play enabled and
disabled. See [Discord setup](discord.md) for the application and activity-sharing
settings needed to display Halo OG in the desktop client.
