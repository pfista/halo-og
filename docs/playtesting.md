# Playtesting Halo OG

New here? Start with the short installation and controls guide for
[Mac](setup-macos.md), [Windows](setup-windows.md), [Linux](setup-linux.md), or
[Android](setup-android.md). This page adds multiplayer tests, map details,
and reporting instructions.

Use the same Halo OG testing release as the other players. The
[download table](../README.md#download) links published packages and explains
matching-commit CI artifacts if a release is unavailable. You do not need to
compile the game. New source changes appear in downloads only when a matching
build is published; the older `test-v0.3.0-net11-dmg2` release is distinguished
below.

Bring your own original Xbox Halo: Combat Evolved disc image (`.iso` / `.xiso`)
or extracted game data. Use one complete set. **USA NTSC is recommended**;
the community downloads require NTSC cache build `01.10.12.2276`. PC, Custom
Edition, Anniversary, and MCC data are not substitutes.

## Mac

Requires Apple Silicon and macOS 26 or later. Use the minimum recorded in
`macos-README.txt` / the package's `README.txt` if it changes in a later build.

1. Open `Halo-OG-macos-arm64.dmg` and drag **Halo OG.app** into **Applications**.
2. Open the app. This testing build is ad-hoc signed and unnotarized; if macOS
   blocks it, use **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway** for
   this app after attempting to open it. See [Mac installation](../port/macos/README.md#download).
3. Choose your Xbox disc image, or **Choose Maps Folder**. A disc import
   extracts maps without changing the image. For a folder, **Copy and Manage**
   copies the maps into the app's data folder; **Use This Folder** keeps the
   external folder selected. Your originals stay in place.
4. Select/create your profile and try a stock map before joining others.

Use **Halo OG → Settings…** or the menu-bar helmet for fullscreen, map selection,
download status, and **Open Saves Folder**. Data lives in
`~/Library/Application Support/Halo OG/`. First launch copies old
`Halo CE Universal` data where needed, preserving old and existing files. A
copy failure stops launch with an explanation so you can correct it and retry.

**Escape** pauses/releases the mouse; **F12** releases or recaptures it.
**WASD** moves, the mouse aims, and the left mouse button fires. Controls can be
remapped; see [Mac controls](../port/macos/README.md#launch).

## Windows

1. Extract `halo-windows-release.zip` into a writable folder. Keep `halo.exe`
   and `SDL3.dll` together; run the extracted executable, not one inside the ZIP.
2. Put one original Xbox `.iso` / `.xiso` beside `halo.exe` and open it.
   New setup builds import it automatically when no original data is found;
   older releases use the disc-image chooser. It extracts `maps` beside the executable.
   An existing complete `maps` folder can also go there.
3. Select/create a profile and try a stock map.

This is a portable 32-bit x86 build for an x86/x86-64 PC with OpenGL 4.5.
An exact Windows runtime minimum has not been established by this playtest.
Settings are in `config.toml` beside the executable; saves default to
`%APPDATA%\Halo OG`. Old `%APPDATA%\halo` saves are copied without overwriting
existing data. See [Windows setup](../port/windows/README.md#start-the-game).

## Linux

1. Extract `halo-linux-release.zip` into a writable folder.
2. Install your distribution's **32-bit** glibc, SDL3, OpenGL/Mesa, and
   PipeWire or PulseAudio client libraries. The executable is 32-bit x86 and
   requires OpenGL 4.5. See [Linux runtime requirements](../port/linux/README.md#requirements)
   for package names; distribution compatibility still needs testing.
3. Put one original Xbox `.iso` / `.xiso` beside `halo`, then run `./halo` from
   that folder. If necessary, first run `chmod +x halo`. New setup builds import
   automatically when no original data is found; select the image if prompted, or
   put a complete `maps` folder beside the executable.
4. Select/create a profile and try a stock map.

Settings are in `config.toml` beside the executable. Saves default to
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/halo-og`, usually `~/.local/share/halo-og`. Old `halo-linux`
saves are copied while preserving existing files. See [Linux setup](../port/linux/README.md#start-the-game).

## Android

1. Extract `halo-android-release.zip` and copy `app-release.apk` to the device.
2. Install the APK, allowing installation from that file source if Android asks.
3. Copy your Xbox disc image onto the device, open Halo OG, and use its file
   picker to select the image. Wait for map extraction to finish.
4. Connect a game controller or keyboard. **Android gameplay has no touch
   controls.** Keep the app in the foreground during a match.

Requires ARM64, Android 9/API 28 or later, and OpenGL ES 3. Device gameplay
is a playtest target. If Android reports a signature conflict with an older
installation, back up its maps/saves before removing it—uninstalling can remove
app data. See [Android installation/data](../port/android/README.md#game-data).

## Play together

1. Confirm everyone uses the **same Halo OG release tag/commit**, protocol 11,
   and matching map data. Old protocol-10 builds cannot join. For this first
   test, use a stock map and leave **PB Options → Stock** selected.
2. The host opens **Multiplayer → System Link** and creates a game. Select a
   stock map such as Blood Gulch and a game type such as Slayer.
3. On the same LAN, clients open **Multiplayer → System Link** and select the
   host's game. Allow local-network/firewall access if your operating system
   prompts; isolated guest Wi-Fi may prevent discovery.
4. New desktop builds discover public Internet games from **games.oghalo.com**
   directly in System Link. Select the host and wait for **Connecting…** to open
   the normal lobby. [Public discovery and private hosting](system-link-directory.md)
   explains the two-machine test and settings. Older builds/private games use
   invites: the host shares the current `halo://join/…` invite
   copied to its clipboard. The client copies the invite and returns to the
   game, or opens the registered invite link. Once the host appears in System
   Link, select it and join. The host app must remain running.
5. Start the match. Check movement, shooting, damage, deaths/respawns, audio,
   and the scoreboard on both machines. Play a second match without restarting.

Physical cross-platform and Internet/NAT play are still being validated. Report
which pairing/network worked or failed; a successful CI build is not proof of
that pairing. [Invite/network details](../port/linux/README.md#internet-play)
and [Mac networking](../port/macos/README.md#launch) cover troubleshooting.

PB Options are optional. The host chooses them in the game type editor or
multiplayer pause menu; all peers need compatible options support. Timer Sounds
additionally require a separately supplied local audio pack.
[PB Options](performance-options.md) explains these settings.

### Spawn, sniper and teleporter regression test

Use the same release on both machines, with stock options. Test stock Derelict
and custom Downrush, then swap host/client roles between Mac and Windows
(include Linux when available). Record which player's view shows each symptom.

- Respawn repeatedly and watch for a prolonged bare reticle before weapons
  appear. Distinguish the brief original ready animation from a delay lasting
  several ticks; report host and joining-player observations separately.
- On a freshly loaded map, watch the first sniper shot from both the shooter's
  view and another player's view, then compare subsequent shots. Repeat after
  picking up a sniper later in the match.
- Enter each teleporter once and stop at the destination. It should keep you
  there; walk away and re-enter to test the normal return trip. Repeat while
  moving and with ordinary network latency.

The automated fixtures cover packet ordering, prediction and texture readiness.
These physical checks confirm whether the reported gameplay symptoms are gone.

## Community maps

First verify a stock-map match. The public collection contains **40 approved
community maps** for original Xbox v5 NTSC data, about **863 MiB** in total.
This includes PB community variants with their normal embedded Halo dependencies;
original disc images, stock map files, campaign files, and `ui.map` are excluded.

The **test-v0.3.0-net11-gameplay1 Mac build** enables **Download approved community maps in the
background** for fresh settings and queues **all 40** approved maps at launch
once original NTSC data is available. A saved opt-out stays off. Open
**Halo OG → Settings…** to disable downloads or use **Check Maps / Retry** when
enabled. Watch its progress/error text. Files go into
`~/Library/Application Support/Halo OG/Community Maps/maps/`; originals and
existing conflicting files are preserved. Installed, verified maps remain
usable with downloads disabled and offline. Reopen map selection after
completion; restart if the session still holds an older selection.

The published **test-v0.3.0-net11-dmg2 Mac build** still needs you to enable
that checkbox and accept its prompt. It can download the existing complete-map
collection, but it does not have the new fresh-settings default.

The **test-v0.3.0-net11-gameplay1 Windows/Linux builds** download all 40 approved community maps in the
background once original NTSC game data is available. Downloads are enabled by
default. To disable them, set `auto_download = false` in the `[community_maps]`
section of `config.toml` beside the executable. Files go into the active game
data root's `maps` folder; existing files are never overwritten. Downloader
status and errors go to standard error (terminal output), separately from the
game's `debug.txt`. To capture them, open a terminal in the extracted build
folder and launch `./halo 2>community-maps.log` on Linux, or
`.\halo.exe 2>community-maps.log` in Windows PowerShell. Wait for downloads to
finish, then restart the game to refresh its map list. Real Windows/Linux
download and gameplay verification is still pending.

The published **test-v0.3.0-net11-dmg2 Windows/Linux packages**, and **Android**,
still need manual maps. Download the same approved
[downrush.map](https://dl.oghalo.com/maps/sha256/3282e580e782f939ae00c63f01971238eb0f85db19a2467efe42b5cb5600d126/downrush.map)
and put it into the active game's `maps` folder, keeping the exact filename.
Windows/Linux usually keep this beside the executable; Android keeps it under
`/sdcard/Android/data/com.halo.decomp/files/maps/` (see its data instructions).
Mac can also use this file manually in its selected `maps` folder. Restart
after adding it. Preserve any existing same-name map first; all participants
must use the same bytes. The approved file is 26,480,640 bytes, SHA-256
`3282e580e782f939ae00c63f01971238eb0f85db19a2467efe42b5cb5600d126`.

For another map, open the [public catalog](https://dl.oghalo.com/catalogs/testing/current.json),
find its `id`, and append its `object_key` to `https://dl.oghalo.com/` to download
the approved file. Keep `<id>.map` as its filename and use the catalog's
`file_bytes` and `sha256` to check it. All players need the same map bytes.
Downrush has completed two consecutive multiplayer matches on one Mac; the
other maps have short local load/render checks, with multiplayer/mode testing
still needed. All 40 public downloads have been checked against their hashes.

</details>

Original stock maps and `ui.map` remain user-imported. A PC/Custom Edition map
cannot be made compatible by renaming it or changing its version field.
[Map conversion](community-maps.md) explains the supported pipeline.

Cloudflare supplies complete playable `.map` files with their embedded Halo
dependencies. Downloads are verified and installed directly; players do not
need a reconstruction toolchain. Original stock maps and disc data still come
from the player's own copy. The package-reconstruction experiment has been set
aside for this release path.

## Report a problem

Open an [issue in Halo OG](https://github.com/pfista/halo-og/issues/new) with:

- The release tag and commit from `provenance.json` or `BuildInfo.txt`.
- Both devices' OS/CPU/GPU, controller or keyboard/mouse, and which is host.
- LAN or Internet, the map/build, game type, and whether PB Options were enabled.
- What you did, what happened, and whether restarting or a stock map changes it.
- Relevant log lines or a screenshot. Mac logs are `halo.log` in Application
  Support; Windows/Linux logs are `debug.txt` in the active data root; Android
  has `debug.txt` in its app data folder.

Do not attach game data, private invite codes, credentials, or personal saves
to a public issue. Check logs for personal paths before sharing. Keep originals
and backups while testing. See [current validation limits](xbox-fidelity.md#reconstruction-target-and-validation).
