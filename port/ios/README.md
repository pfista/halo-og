# iPhone development build

This port targets iPhone 17 Pro Max, arm64, iOS 26.0 or later. It uses the
existing game and Xbox SDK inputs from the local Mac setup. The renderer uses
ANGLE's Metal backend and inherits the Mac vertex-upload and occlusion-query
fixes. The first build uses the display's landscape aspect ratio at a 480-pixel
internal height, scaled to the native drawable.

## Build

First complete [Apple build setup](../../docs/apple-build.md), including full
Xcode 26+, CMake, the public dependencies, your local game maps and XDK headers.
You do not need to build the Mac app or the simulator first.
`DEVELOPER_DIR` defaults to `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`;
the build does not change the system's selected developer directory.

Sign into Xcode → Settings → Accounts with your own Apple account. Connect and
unlock the iPhone, trust the Mac, and enable Developer Mode in Settings →
Privacy & Security (restart and confirm when prompted).

A paid development team was required to provision
`com.apple.developer.kernel.extended-virtual-addressing` in testing; Xcode rejected
this capability for Personal Teams. The generic capability is in
[Halo.entitlements](Halo.entitlements). It expands virtual address space without
allocating that amount of physical RAM. If provisioning fails, check that your
team/profile supports this capability; removing it will not produce a working
physical-device build.

Find your own Team ID in your Apple developer membership, and choose a unique
reverse-DNS app identifier. Replace both example values below:

```sh
python3 tools/ios_build.py --platform device --sign \
  --team YOUR_TEAM_ID --bundle-id com.yourname.halo
```

This compiles the game, builds SDL and the native host, packages the maps, and
asks Xcode to provision/sign with your local account. No signing identity is
provided by this repository. Outputs:

- `build/ios/device/Release-iphoneos/Halo.app`
- `build/ios/device/HaloIOS.xcodeproj` (select the **Halo** scheme)

Omit `--sign` and `--team` for an unsigned compile check. To use the Xcode UI,
open the generated project, choose your team under Signing & Capabilities,
select your connected iPhone, and run **Halo**. Use Release configuration for
performance testing. Rerunning the build script regenerates the project from
source, so pass your team and bundle ID on subsequent signed command-line builds.

`--host-only` reuses the compiled game image for signing/UI-only changes. Omit it
when game sources, compiler code or generated bridges change. `--platform both`
builds the simulator and device hosts from the same engine image.

## Install on a phone

With `DEVELOPER_DIR` set as in the setup guide:

```sh
xcrun devicectl list devices
xcrun devicectl device install app \
  --device DEVICE_ID build/ios/device/Release-iphoneos/Halo.app
xcrun devicectl device process launch \
  --device DEVICE_ID com.yourname.halo
```

Replace `DEVICE_ID` with your phone's identifier and use the bundle ID passed
at build time. Alternatively, use Xcode's Run button. The default bundle ID is
`local.halo.og.ios`; choose your own for device provisioning to avoid
registration conflicts.

The default local build includes `assets/maps` (roughly 1.8 GB). Use
`--no-bundle-maps` to omit them, open the app once, then copy your `maps` folder
into its `Documents/GameData/` through Finder file sharing or Files → On My iPhone
→ Halo. Reopen the app after copying. It prefers `Documents/GameData/maps` over
bundled maps. Saves, `config.toml` and `halo.log` are in `Library/Application Support/Halo`
inside the app container. Do not publish the app bundle or local signing logs.

For multiplayer on a physical phone, see [Mac and iPhone System Link](../../docs/apple-multiplayer.md).

## Invite links

The app registers `halo-og://join/...` invite links. Opening one starts Halo OG
or delivers it to the running game. SDL's UIKit scene delegate retains links
during startup and sends later links through the same native event bridge; the
complete invite is written atomically to this app's save folder for the game's
next network poll. Internet play must be enabled in `config.toml`.

The app does not register the inherited `halo://` scheme. Earlier invitations
can still be copied into the game through its existing clipboard join setting.
iOS does not use the desktop Discord RPC integration.

The default development bundle identifier is now `local.halo.og.ios`. Continue
passing an existing signed build's `--bundle-id` when updating that app to retain
its container and saved data; a different identifier installs a separate app.

## Simulator

No device development team is needed:

```sh
python3 tools/ios_build.py --platform simulator
xcrun simctl list devices available
```

Choose an installed iPhone simulator's UUID, then:

```sh
xcrun simctl boot SIMULATOR_ID   # skip if already booted
open -a Simulator
xcrun simctl bootstatus SIMULATOR_ID -b
xcrun simctl install SIMULATOR_ID build/ios/simulator/Release-iphonesimulator/Halo.app
SIMCTL_CHILD_HALO_TOUCH_CONTROLS=1 xcrun simctl launch \
  SIMULATOR_ID local.halo.og.ios
```

Use your selected `--bundle-id` in the launch command if you overrode the default.
Simulator performance does not predict phone performance.

## Controls

Touch input uses two sticks plus A/B/X/Y, triggers, crouch, zoom, flashlight,
grenade type, Back and Pause. These feed the existing Xbox controller mapping.
The layout is an initial playable implementation; sensitivity and ergonomics
still need testing on the phone. Physical controllers use SDL's GameController
backend, and touch controls hide when a system controller is present. Physical
gamepad gameplay has not yet been validated on the iPhone.

For simulator touch testing, launch with `SIMCTL_CHILD_HALO_TOUCH_CONTROLS=1`
before `xcrun simctl launch`; the simulator may advertise a system gamepad.
`HALO_TOUCH_CONTROLS=0` hides the overlay. The Mac window uses neither setting.

## Frame rate

The app opts into ProMotion and SDL requests the display's maximum refresh
rate: 120 Hz on supported iPhones, 60 Hz on other displays. ANGLE/Metal vsync
paces presentation. The engine interpolates rendered frames between its
unchanged 30 Hz simulation ticks, so higher frame rates do not speed up gameplay.
Keep `display.interpolation` and `display.vsync` enabled in `config.toml`.

For a 60 Hz comparison or lower-power session, set `HALO_IOS_REFRESH_RATE=60`
in the Xcode scheme's environment or pass it through `devicectl`:

```sh
xcrun devicectl device process launch --terminate-existing --device DEVICE_ID \
  --environment-variables '{"HALO_IOS_REFRESH_RATE":"60"}' com.yourname.halo
```

Omit the variable (or set it to `120`) to request the display's maximum again.
This is a refresh-rate preference, not a guarantee of sustained 120 FPS: iOS can
reduce the rate for Low Power Mode, the Accessibility → Motion → Limit Frame
Rate setting, or thermal conditions. See Apple's
[ProMotion guidance](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/optimizing-iphone-and-ipad-apps-to-support-promotion-displays).

For device measurements, set `HALO_PERF_LOG=1` at launch. This writes per-frame
timings to `Library/Application Support/Halo/frames.csv` in the app container;
each profiled launch overwrites that file. `frame_ms` measures the interval
between completed buffer swaps (about 8.33 ms at 120 FPS or 16.67 ms at 60 FPS),
not GPU execution time or proof that every frame reached the screen. Use
Instruments' Game Performance/Metal timeline to inspect GPU and presentation
behavior. Profiling is off on ordinary launches.

## Runtime design

The game retains 32-bit pointers and structure layouts. Its ARM instructions
are embedded into the app's signed Mach-O `__TEXT,__halo` section at build time.
The ELF is an intermediate build artifact, not runtime-loaded executable code.
No JIT, writable executable mapping or runtime instruction patching is used.

The LLVM adapter materializes original game addresses and translates data
accesses into a separate non-executable arena at `0x400000000`. Only the span
below guest address `0x90000000` is reserved (2.25 GB of virtual space); actual
memory is committed as used. Indirect calls add an immutable code-image delta.
Native callbacks use the same translation. Thread-local control blocks are
lowered before rebasing. iOS has a distinct ABI version to prevent mixing its
image with the Mac or Android loaders.

## Verification

```sh
python3 -m unittest tools.test_mobile_invites
python3 tools/ios_invite_smoke.py
python3 tools/test_ios_runtime.py
python3 tools/ios_mac_runtime_check.py
python3 tools/macos_benchmark.py \
  --host build/ios/mac-runtime-check/halo --guest build/ios/halo_guest.elf \
  --output build/ios/mac-runtime-check/campaign --effects --seconds 45
```

The invite smoke creates and removes a separate simulator. It uses SDL's UIKit
delegate, the production native invite/event bridge and the iOS bundle template
to check cold and warm URL opens with complete 79-byte links. It requires the
existing simulator SDL build and an installed simulator runtime. It neither
installs on a phone nor joins a network game.
Show the **Halo OG URI probe** device in Simulator or Xcode's Device Hub, then
tap **Open** when iOS asks **Open in Halo OG?** for either URI.

The standalone signed-image test covers globals, indirect calls, stack pointers,
unaligned accesses, atomics, varargs and Xbox memory addresses. The Mac diagnostic
host exercises the complete iPhone engine layout independently of UIKit and
device signing. It is not an iPhone performance benchmark.

On September 27, 2026, the 45-second Mac diagnostic campaign with repeated
explosions exited successfully: median frame time 16.66 ms, p95 17.11 ms,
maximum measured footprint 465 MB. Mac allocator and audio regression probes
also passed. The iPhone simulator rendered the menu at 2868×1320 with Metal and
displayed touch controls. A development build on iPhone 17 Pro Max with
iOS 26.6.2 confirmed the signed engine, 2868×1320 Metal drawable and A19 Pro GPU.
Campaign gameplay, movement/aiming, touch controls and audio were tested on the
phone.

ProMotion validation on the same phone measured the following buffer-swap
intervals with optional frame logging enabled:

| Session | Duration | Average FPS | Median frame | p95 frame |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 60 Hz override, main menu | 15 s | 59.99 | 16.66 ms | 16.82 ms |
| 120 Hz target, campaign play | 179 s | 119.42 | 8.33 ms | 8.61 ms |

The campaign capture included 21,368 frames, a 9.65 ms p99, an isolated
114.97 ms maximum frame, and a 455 MiB peak physical footprint. A separate
1.70-second sequence of 205 Metal drawable presentation callbacks in Instruments
averaged 119.97 FPS; the trace reported a nominal thermal state. Movement,
aiming, firing and audio were confirmed on the device. The menu and campaign
rows cover different workloads; these short checks do not establish a sustained
120 FPS minimum across every level or long thermal sessions.

Bink movies remain unsupported, as in the Mac port. Multiplayer, sustained
thermal behavior, background/resume behavior and the full campaign require
separate device testing before treating this as a finished iPhone release.
