/*
HALO_ANDROID_ABI.H

The contract between the two halves of the Android port (see
port/android/README.md):

- the guest: the game, the platform layer shared with the Linux port and a
  small C runtime, compiled as ILP32 AArch64 code (32-bit pointers) and
  linked into a static image that runs in the low 4 GB of the process;
- the host: an ordinary 64-bit Android library (libmain.so) that loads the
  image, owns the process (SDL3, OpenGL ES, bionic) and serves the guest's
  requests.

The guest calls the host through import stubs that jump through a table of
64-bit function pointers the host fills in at load time. Only types whose
layout and register treatment agree between the two ABIs cross this
boundary: 32-bit integers, 64-bit integers, floats, and pointers (which
arm64_32 always passes zero-extended). Structures shared here are made of
fixed-width members only.

This header is included by both halves.
